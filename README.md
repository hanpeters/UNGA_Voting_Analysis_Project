# UN Membership & Voting Records Datasets

A repository of datasets documenting United Nations membership and General Assembly voting records for current and historical member states. 

## Overview

This project aims to provide a set of databases th

## Features

- **Complete membership records**: Current and past UN member states with start and end dates
- **ISO country codes**: Added as primary keys for efficient searching and dataset joining operations
- **Voting records**: UN General Assembly (UNGA) voting data for comprehensive analysis
- **Historical coverage**: Includes defunct states and territorial changes over time

## Why This Project?

Existing public datasets for UN membership and voting records are often incomplete, outdated, or lack the standardized identifiers needed for data analysis and research. This repository fills that gap by providing clean, well-structured datasets that are ready for academic research, policy analysis, and data visualization projects. The project has just started (June 2025), so it is still work in progress.

## Getting Started

### Data Structure
Datasets includes:
- Country/state identifiers (ISO codes, UN codes, names)
- Membership start and end dates
- Voting records with resolution details


### Usage Examples
- Political science research on voting patterns
- International relations analysis
- Data visualization of UN dynamics
- Academic studies on multilateral diplomacy
