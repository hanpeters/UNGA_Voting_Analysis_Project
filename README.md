# UNGA Voting Analysis Project

A comprehensive tool for analyzing and comparing voting behavior of UN member states in the General Assembly from 1946 to present.

## üìã Overview

The United Nations publishes voting records for all General Assembly sessions since 1946, but raw data requires preprocessing for meaningful analysis. This project creates clean, standardized datasets and builds analytical tools to explore voting patterns and trends over nearly 80 years of UN history.

**Key Challenge Addressed**: Existing UN voting datasets suffer from inconsistent country naming conventions and lack of standardized identifiers, making comparative analysis difficult.

## ‚ú® Features

### Data Processing
- **Standardized country identifiers**: ISO 3166 and UN M49 codes for reliable data joining
- **Historical completeness**: Includes former member states (USSR, GDR, Yugoslavia, etc.)
- **Name harmonization**: Resolves country name variations across different time periods
- **Continental/regional mapping**: Geographic groupings for regional analysis

### Analytical Capabilities
- **Voting pattern comparison**: Compare any combination of countries across time periods
- **Alliance detection**: Identify voting blocs and diplomatic coalitions
- **Resolution analysis**: Examine voting behavior by topic, sponsor, or outcome
- **Temporal trends**: Track how voting relationships evolve over decades

### Web Interface *(Planned)*
- Interactive dashboards for non-technical users
- Customizable visualizations and export options

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Academic Research**: Political science studies on international relations and multilateral diplomacy
- **Policy Analysis**: Understanding voting coalitions and diplomatic influence
- **Journalism**: Data-driven reporting on UN dynamics and country relationships  
- **Data Science**: Training datasets for network analysis and clustering algorithms
